I have been thinking about writing a blog for the longest while.
The way I learn something the best is it if I write it down, because of this I have accumulated a large collection of notes on a variety of topics.  
This blog will be motivation for me to clean up some of these notes and post them.
At the least, I will relearn some of these topics, hopefully they can benefit someone else.  

If you like some of my writing or want to discuss some of these topics, feel free to shoot me a message on LinkedIn.
